                <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
                <p>My ideal job listing can be seen <a href="https://apply.workable.com/go1careers/j/1471103CB4/" target="_blank">here</a>. A PDF copy can be viewed <a href="Senior Developer.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></p>
                <p>The senior developer role involves the development, maintenance, testing and deployment of software programs for go1 PTY LTD, a company that provides high-quality learning modules and courses from a range of topics. As a senior developer at go1, my daily tasks will include building, deploying, testing, and troubleshooting software that will be used for the company's educational platform. Given that the Senior developer is expected to have at least five years of experience in previous software development roles, it will be expected that they will be able to share their wealth of knowledge with less experienced members of the team and mentor junior developers to create a culture of growth and success. The senior developer will also be able to translate the businesses needs into a technical solution to provide the best outcome that aligns with the goals of go1 PTY LTD: to provide world-leading online education. This role appeals to me because it combines my interest in using code to develop programs and software that impacts the end user whether it be for educational purposes, for enjoyment, or to automate tasks. I also have a passion for sharing knowledge, so being able to assist and mentor junior developers will be rewarding as I will be directly involved in not only my success, but also the success of colleagues.</p>
                <p>A senior developer for go1 PTY LTD will require 5 years of previous software development experience and be proficient in at least one core development platform from NodeJs, PHP, React/Typescript (Go1 PtyLtd, 2021). The senior developer will also need to have experience in testing the quality of software systems and be able to explain concepts clearly without using jargon so they can be understood by different stakeholders within the business. The job description does not state this specifically, however, given that it is a senior position it would be safe to assume that the senior developer has a comprehensive knowledge of several different programming languages such as Python, Java, Javascript, SQL, HTML, and CSS.</p>
                <p>I currently have a combined 2 years of experience in a contact centre as a customer service advisor: 1 year as an advisor support agent, and 6 months as a customer service trainer across both a bank and a transport company. I also have completed a Victorian Certificate of Education, and have very basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Java.</p> 
                <p>To become a suitable candidate for the Senior Developer role at go1 PTY LTD, I plan on completing my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT to gain the necessary skills to be able to enter a graduate role in software development. Once graduated I hope to work as a junior software developer to break into the field and refine my skills and find what kind of software development I am passionate about. While working as a junior developer I will aim to continuously better myself by learning about new trends and discover potential developing areas in the industry. After working as a developer for five or more years and having experience translating business needs into technical solutions, this is when I would plan on applying to become a senior developer.</p>
