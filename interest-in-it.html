                <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
                <img src="RMIT.png">
                <p>My interest in IT started ever since I was about 6 years old. I asked my mum a science question, but she did not know the answer to it. My mum went away and found out the answer for me. I asked her how she got this information and that's when she explained to me what the internet was. Ever since that day, I was fascinated by the internet, what it could be used for, and eventually computers and the capabilities they have. Currently, my interest in IT lies around programming. I’m captivated by how writing lines of code can instruct a computer to do exactly what you want it to do and how the possibilities that computer programming has is endless. As of today, I don’t have formal experience in information technology. The only experience I have is taking a few lessons online in markup languages and programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and Java.</p>
                <p>I chose to come to RMIT because RMIT has a reputation for producing high-quality graduates in information technology and computer science. In 2020 RMIT ranked in the top 150 institutions globally for computer science and information systems according to the QS World University Rankings (QS Quacquarelli Symonds Limited, 2020). I also chose RMIT because the Bachelor of Information Technology can be studied entirely online which works perfectly well with me since I also study full time and won't be able to attend campus for classes and tutorials. I can study with just my computer and an internet connection, so it doesn’t matter where I am.</p>
                <p>Throughout the Bachelor of Information Technology, I expect to learn about a broad range of topics including programming, software engineering, cyber security, and cloud computing. In addition to this, I am expecting that the degree will teach me how to think like an IT professional and how to work in teams to deliver projects just like I will need to do in my future career in technology. By the end of the course, I'm expecting to have an understanding of the latest trends in information technology so that I am a desirable candidate for a new career in the industry.</p>
